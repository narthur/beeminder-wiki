# What Is Beeminder?

Beeminder is a service that helps you keep track of what you *want* to be doing, but maybe are having trouble actually following-through. It takes data, either that you enter or that's automatically entered from dozens of different services (see [Integrations][1]), and it keeps track of data in a cool graph! The catch is that you set an amount you must do per day/week/month, and if that amount isn't met then you get charged money. That's the *sting* of Beeminder!
