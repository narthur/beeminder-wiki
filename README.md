**What is Beeminder?** Beeminder is a service that helps you keep track of what you _want_ to be doing, but maybe are having trouble actually following-through. It takes data, either that you enter or that's automatically entered from dozens of different services (*see [Integrations](integrations.md)*), and it keeps track of data in a cool graph! The catch is that you set an amount you must do per day/week/month, and if that amount isn't met then you get charged money. That's the _sting_ of Beeminder!

## The Beeminder Philosophy

Beeminder works by breaking down your long-term goal and turning it into concrete day-to-day actions with associated deadlines. These deadlines, and the monetary sting they threaten, serve to take a small part of the price you'd pay by not achieving your goal and bring it into the present, allowing your long-term goal to influence your day-to-day behavior.
